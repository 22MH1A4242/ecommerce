### Documentation for Building an E-Commerce Website

#### 1. **Introduction**
- What an e-commerce website is and its importance?
- Purpose of building this project:
  - To create a user-friendly interface for customers to browse and purchase products.
  - To provide an admin dashboard for managing products and orders.

#### 2. **Overview of the Website**
- Highlight the key pages and their purposes:
  1. **Home Page (`index.php`)**: Displays the products available for sale.
  2. **Login Page (`pages/login.php`)**: Allows users to log in to their accounts.
  3. **Registration Page (`pages/register.php`)**: Enables new users to sign up.
  4. **Cart Page (`pages/cart.php`)**: Displays selected products for purchase.
  5. **Admin Login (`admin/login.php`)**: Provides access to the admin dashboard.
  6. **Admin Dashboard (`admin/dashboard.php`)**: Central hub for admin operations.
  7. **Add Product (`admin/add_product.php`)**: Allows admins to add new products.
  8. **Manage Products (`admin/manage_products.php`)**: Enables editing or deleting existing products.

#### 3. **Setting Up the Project**
1. **Unzipping the Files**:
   - Extract the files from the provided ZIP folder.
   - Organize the project folder structure as follows:
     ```
     ecommerce/
     |-- admin/
     |   |-- add_product.php
     |   |-- login.php
     |   |-- dashboard.php
     |   |-- logout.php
     |   |-- manage_products.php
     |
     |-- css/
     |   |-- style.css
     |
     |-- images/
     |   |-- cart-icon.png
     |   |-- product1.jpg
     |   |-- product2.jpg
     |   |-- ...
     |
     |-- includes/
     |   |-- db.php
     |
     |-- pages/
     |   |-- login.php
     |   |-- register.php
     |   |-- cart.php
     |   |-- logout.php
     |
     |-- index.php
     ```
2. **Setting Up a Local Server**:
   - Install **XAMPP** or **WAMP** to set up a local server.
   - Place the `ecommerce` folder inside the `htdocs` directory (for XAMPP) or the appropriate folder for your server.

3. **Database Configuration**:
   - Open `includes/db.php` to configure the database connection.
   - Replace the placeholder values with your database credentials:
     ```php
     $servername = "localhost";
     $username = "root";
     $password = "";
     $dbname = "ecommerce_db";
     ```
   - Create a database named `ecommerce_db` and import the provided SQL file if available, or set up tables manually during the walkthrough.

4. **Testing the Setup**:
   - Start the local server.
   - Access the website by visiting `http://localhost/ecommerce` in your browser.

#### 4. **Building the Home Page (`index.php`)**
- Explain the structure of the homepage:
  - Display products dynamically using data from the database.
  - Include a navigation bar and footer for consistent design.
- Add a step-by-step code walkthrough:
  1. Fetch product data from the database.
  2. Use a loop to display product cards with images, titles, and prices.
  3. Add "Add to Cart" buttons for functionality (to be implemented later).

#### 5. **Next Steps**
After completing the homepage, proceed to:
1. **User Authentication System**:
   - Set up the registration (`pages/register.php`) and login (`pages/login.php`) pages.
   - Explain how to securely handle user credentials using password hashing.
2. **Admin Panel**:
   - Build the admin login and dashboard.
   - Create functionality for adding and managing products.

#### 6. **Conclusion**
- Reiterate the goals of the project.
- Encourage viewers to test each feature as they build.
- Provide a link to download the complete project files and database schema (if applicable).
